                <p>
                    On the terrace of our worn-down tin-roofed home,<br>
                    the American flag flies out of place.<br>
                    It is July, and my father insists<br>
                    on celebrating his American heritage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our ancestry says otherwise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At school, we're told to only speak English.<br>
                    “You'll be more valuable,” they say.<br>
                    Frightened of being punished and fined,<br>
                    we speak in hushed voices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Splashes of water hit my feet.<br>
                    I bask in the warm sunlight.<br>
                    Across the pool, my mother calls me into the shade.<br>
                    “You wouldn't want to get darker,” she says.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My pass to the American Dream<br>
                    is tucked between the pages of my passport<br>
                    Flight PR 102. Gate N6. Seat 71C.<br>
                    Manila to Los Angeles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plane ascends<br>
                    Through the porthole,<br>
                    I wave goodbye to all I have ever known.<br>
                    My mother stays behind,<br>
                    yet her comments linger on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once there, who will I become?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The school bell rings. They tell us<br>
                    to stand and face the flag, to pledge<br>
                    allegiance in a crowd of unfamiliar faces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loyalty to my country unfaltering,<br>
                    I stay silent in my seat.

                    <strong>Idaho summer days</strong><br>
                        By Sonakshi Sharma
                </p>
                <p>
                    stretched out until 8pm, me and my neighbors Caitlyn and Rachel playing hockey with someone’s shoe in the safety of our Boise cul-de-sac.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mama was on the phone with her sisters and Papa was with Dadi in the backyard planting cilantro. Erita was doing whatever American-born 2-year-olds do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I had Kumon and piano practice with the only other brown kids in our town the next day. And of course, Caitlyn (with a C) couldn’t even say my name when I saw her in Lowell Scott Middle School’s hallways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I knew that when Nani died, Mama wouldn’t be able to go to her funeral in India. I knew it would split her apart like a pyre, like the waves did with her mother’s ashes on the Ganga River, like the senate-born immigration system promised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I knew that in a couple of years, I would inadvertently mispronounce an English word in high school and my classmates would laugh fully, through their throats, and I would wonder why Mrs. Bleu hadn’t added that word to my ESL lessons. I knew this would stay with me for the rest of my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it was 8pm in August/September and I knew if I tried, I could make this puck-shot last forever, forever across the rounded American asphalt, past the American houses, into the American park, over the American pond, out of my (American) heart.

                    <strong>Thoughts on my mother-tongue</strong><br>
                    By NAME
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before my mother could teach me the alphabet of a language<br>
                    Of a land she left behind years ago<br>
                    My brother had already taught me what I needed to know:<br>
                    Curse-words<br>
                    With the precision of a sniper<br>
                    I could call those around me<br>
                    A dog, useless, pig and ugly<br>
                    Devastating egos, and my parents, with each verbal shot<br>
                    How strange to be taught how to harm<br>
                    Before the foundation is laid<br>
                    To carry weapons you have never even seen
                </p>
                <p>
                    English was deemed the necessary baseline<br>
                    The ocean surrounding me and my family<br>
                    While we clung on to our boat made of our mother tongue<br>
                    I was never taught how to row<br>
                    And yet I picked up a paddle anyway<br>
                    It did not fit my hands the way it is supposed to<br>
                    The language I was meant to learn first<br>
                    Does not fit in my mouth the way it is supposed to<br>
                    Can you even be robbed of something you never had in the first place?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cannot find myself within my mother tongue<br>
                    I search behind syllables this American-born mouth mispronounces<br>
                    Past the condescending laughter of family back home<br>
                    Past the mistranslations of an overused google translate app<br>
                    It is like searching in the dark with a broken flashlight<br>
                    I search and search but all I can conjure<br>
                    Is small talk and curse-words<br>
                    But nothing to prove I exist in my mother-tongue
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet English has a place for me<br>
                    Has a name for me<br>
                    Non-binary<br>
                    And while I am happy I know who I am in English<br>
                    I cannot be satisfied with being able to exist in only one language<br>
                    My mother tongue rejects my identity<br>
                    The way my mouth rejects her presence<br>
                    The difference is she never even tried to fit me in the first place
                </p>
                <p>
                    The language of the land my mother left decades ago<br>
                    Has no space for me to exist as I am<br>
                    And yet, I love her still.
                </p>

                    living in the desert where water and the highway are close. sonic cousins through white marriages. No one looks at the oak’s descendants anymore, those leafy spinsters.<br>
                    They shed their attempts at connection on leashed dogs who are unaware of their role as trademarks of domesticity. Birds don’t get labeled as “purebreds,” their wings don’t get yanked by youth who weren’t taught boundaries. Birds get amber chests and freedom. I get misinformation, power washed histories. I was trained to avoid flight, but as I notice these birds the length of my index finger, I can’t help but wonder if I would be proud to have a body

                <p>
                    if yellow was wrapped around my chest. I look up and<br>
                    become the recipient of shedding. Maybe trees are the only falling things that don’t look helpless. The Sun continues to be another star that’s rationed off.

                    of her womb two turns too soon,<br>

                    But nothing can smuggle me across the border in the back of a truck<br>
                    the way they did my grandmother I am the country,<br>
                    both the dictator inducing the famine and the peasant starving to death.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every time I look in the mirror<br>
                    I see myself split<br>
                    into an infinity of selves and<br>
                    my eyes roll back<br>
                    and I have named the valleys<br>
                    in the lining of my skull.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Somehow I am the family who<br>
                    cannot afford a burial,<br>
                    I am the unrelenting priest, and<br>
                    I am the dead child.<br>
                    Perhaps I am becoming<br>
                    the religion they adopted out of desperation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I stand on my back,<br>
                    I can see<br>
                    the flames of Dresden<br>
                    in the distance and<br>
                    in the valleys<br>
                    of my knees, my mother<br>
                    contemplates drowning herself.<br>
                    Behind me there’s<br>
                    a string of small Texas<br>
                    towns that bare my name<br>
                    because I slit my wrist<br>
                    and let the blood drip over a map.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I heave and shake, all<br>
                    that comes up is milk<br>
                    because my mother’s uncle<br>
                    sold his farm,<br>
                    then bought the farm,<br>
                    and now a thousand tiny babes rest beneath my breast bone,<br>
                    every one of them<br>
                    an artist and poet.<br>
                    Deep in my lungs,<br>
                    my grandfather’s grandfather mines for coal and it’s leaking<br>
                    out the back of my neck.<br>
                    The tip of my nose<br>
                    is my pulpit,<br>
                    where I preach in the ghost<br>
                    of a language I never knew,<br>
                    while my children sit<br>
                    dutifully in rows<br>
                    in front of my naked body,<br>
                    and I’m breaking
                </p>
                <p>
                    and splitting,<br>
                    I can hear the war cry of the Gauls even as my navel is the Rubicon, and behind them<br>
                    are the Celts who<br>
                    haven’t yet left the for<br>
                    the island in the center of my eye. I’m ankle deep in<br>
                    the Tiber, which is<br>
                    the Danube, which is<br>
                    my father’s beard,<br>
                    which is lost somewhere in my hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loki’s secret cave is actually in my chest, and though I am not him,<br>
                    I am the poison dripping<br>
                    off the snake<br>
                    and the god’s rotting nose<br>
                    and Sigyn’s left eye<br>
                    and the memory of what’s coming<br>
                    and I’ve always known:<br>
                    the end times must come from me.

                    <strong>Desired Destiny</strong><br>
                    By NAME
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my younger years, when my thoughts were not that profound,<br>
                    when even in the shallow waters at shore I would drown,<br>
                    all of the pain and the struggle that I saw,<br>
                    much of it through the eyes of the adults who cared for me and showed me love, ignited a blue flame in my core that cannot be snuffed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I began to dare to swim farther into the oceans,<br>
                    to pursue my desired destiny.<br>
                    And then I found myself here,<br>
                    as a displaced teen who left behind dear family.<br>
                    Although I surrendered the future I would've reached had I stayed,<br>
                    I'm set to arrange my own fate, wherever I am.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I won't be taken by the current that drove me away;<br>
                    even when traversing uncertain paths, I know<br>
                    the destinations I would walk barefoot<br>
                    for countless miles to get to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I dive into these violent seas up ahead<br>
                    because I know that despite all the water I may take in,<br>
                    a brighter future is at their end.
                </p>
